Traffic Generator and Transmitter For NDN (ndn-traffic)
=================================================

This project includes two parts, designed to emulate traffic flow in an NDN network. It can generate different types of Interests, then transmit them, and finally receive Datas responded.

The tools in directory /generator can generate offline traffic files beforehand. Its traffic types include zipf distribution with various alpha, cache pollution attack, interest flooding attack. And thereâ€™re some emulator to evaluate the performance of those traffic in terms of rtt, throupug, cs hit rate, etc.

Then, tools in directory /transmitter can transmit traffic in files generated by generator. The tool named ndn-client can send Interests and ndn-server will respond legal ones with corresponding Datas.
